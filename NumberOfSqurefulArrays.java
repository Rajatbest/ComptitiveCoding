/*
Number of Squareful Arrays

Problem Description

Given an array of integers A, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Find and return the number of permutations of A that are squareful. Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].



Problem Constraints

1 <= length of the array <= 12

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

The only argument given is the integer array A.


Output Format

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.


Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [2, 2, 2]

Input 2:

 A = [1, 17, 8]



Example Output

Output 1:

 1

Output 2:

 2



Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Only permutation is [2, 2, 2], the sum of adjacent element is 4 and 4 and both are perfect square.

Explanation 2:

 Permutation are [1, 8, 17] and [17, 8, 1].

/*
Solution Approach

Construct a graph where an edge from i to j exists if A[i] + A[j] is a perfect square.

Our goal is to investigate Hamiltonian paths of this graph: paths that visit all the nodes exactly once.

Letâ€™s keep a current count of what values of nodes are left to visit, and a count todo of how many nodes left to visit.

From each node, we can explore all neighboring nodes (by value, which reduces the complexity).
